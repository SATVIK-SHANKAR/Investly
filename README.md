# 💹 Investly

**Investly** is a smart investment planning web application built with **Next.js** and powered by **real-time market data** from the TradingView API. Based on a user’s investment amount and risk tolerance, the app uses an intelligent algorithm to generate personalized portfolio allocations across asset classes.

## 🎯 Purpose

Investly aims to democratize portfolio allocation for everyday investors. By combining intuitive UI with smart logic, Investly helps users answer:

- _"How should I distribute my money across stocks, bonds, crypto, and cash?"_
- _"What’s a good mix for my current risk profile?"_

Whether you're risk-averse or an aggressive investor, Investly tailors the allocation to match your financial comfort zone.

## 🧠 Investment Allocation Algorithm

Investly uses a simple yet effective **rule-based allocation algorithm** that maps user inputs to predefined portfolio mixes.

### 1. **User Input**

- 💰 Investment Amount (e.g., ₹100,000)
- ⚖️ Risk Tolerance:
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High

### 2. **Mapped Portfolio Strategy**

Based on modern portfolio theory (inspired by lazy portfolios like Ray Dalio’s All Weather), each risk level maps to a fixed percentage allocation:

| Asset Class | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Stocks      | 20%      | 50%         | 70%       |
| Bonds       | 50%      | 30%         | 10%       |
| Crypto      | 5%       | 10%         | 15%       |
| Cash        | 25%      | 10%         | 5%        |

> Example: A ₹100,000 investment with "High" risk results in ₹70,000 in stocks, ₹10,000 in bonds, ₹15,000 in crypto, and ₹5,000 in cash.

This approach keeps the logic transparent and extendable for future dynamic modeling or ML integration.
